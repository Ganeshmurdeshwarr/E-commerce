🔐 Authentication & Security

JWT-based authentication
Role-based access control (User / Admin)
Protected API routes using middleware
Secure password hashing with bcrypt
Conditional Authorization headers to prevent malformed JWT errors

🧠 Key Engineering Decisions

Redux Toolkit for scalable global state management
Derived state over duplicated state to avoid unnecessary renders
Optimistic UI updates for admin order status changes
Conditional API authorization to support guest users
Centralized error handling
Clean separation of concerns

⚠️ Edge Cases Handled

Guest checkout redirect to login
Prevented malformed JWT errors
Prevented unnecessary page re-renders
Correct handling of async state updates
Proper dependency management in useEffect
